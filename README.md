# Cloud Janitor Agent with ADK

This is the companion repository for the [Introduction to Agents with ADK](https://ghacks.dev/hacks/adk-intro) gHack. It includes a basic agent that will be amended with each challenge to build a complete Agentic AI solution for cleaning up idle resources in Google Cloud Projects. The goal of the gHack is to introduce the various ADK concepts in a real-world scenario.
